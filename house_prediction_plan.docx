STEP 1:
Come up with a goal of the data set. E.g Predict House prices in the london area using postcode, no of bedrooms, sqft, etc

STEP 2:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - get info on type of data values,
statiscal summary of dataset (mean, std, etc),
visulisation plots (different plots to find out any relationships in the data and outliers. different distributions vs house prices),
check and drop null values/useless columns

STEP 3:
Dataset prepation (Splitting and Scaling) - Using ML to train and test an algorithm for price prediction.

STEP 4:
Model selection and Evaluation - So use two different ML models;
(Multiple Linear Regression and Keras Regressions which are a neural network).
