# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in London using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about house prices, their locations, postal codes, number of bathrooms and bedrooms, and square footage.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training the machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore relationships between house prices and various features using data visualization techniques.
- Identify patterns and insights in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Models
- Train two machine learning models: RandomForestRegressor and DecisionTreeRegressor.
- Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE).
- Compare the performance of the models and select the best-performing one.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/magnus-wright/House-Price-Prediction-Model.git
